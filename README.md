----------------------

This is a practice machine learning project, to implement feature and model selection. I've chosen a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository entitled [Heart Disease Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), and have used the preprocessed cleveland data.
